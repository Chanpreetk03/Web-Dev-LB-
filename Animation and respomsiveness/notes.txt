ANIMATION and RESPONSIVENESS

CLASS - 1

What is responsiveness?

A design of webpage with which it looks good on all devices.
laptop, phone, ipad, tablet etc.
display:grid;

Grid area:

the numbers written in front of grid=column-start and such properties are the number of lines.
the gaps are called lines

now rather than using different commands for row and col start and end we csn also use grid-area



grid-area:grid-row-start/grid-column-start/grid-row-end/grid-column-end

grid-template-area: in this we name rows and colums and then create our layoutdoub

doubt on grid template

Media queries

use :vh % rem
basically like if else if site is larger than this or less than this 
on differnt devices using breakpoint

USING FLEX AND GEID TOGETHER

ANIMATION 
moving objects 
it lets an element change from style 1 to style 2 graduallly.
Functions in css

basically a block of code in which you give output which gives an output
For eg(rbb,repeat,scale,translate)


function:
calc() it solves the expression and gives the value
min(),max()


Variables:same as any lang
like you have a colour which has to be written everywhereyou can declare a varible.

to use it in the complete file declare it globally in the root.
scope of variable.
why use root variable in root not universal selector? 

--var_name:value
property:var(var_name)
