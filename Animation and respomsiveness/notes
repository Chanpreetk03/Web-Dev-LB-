ANIMATION AND RESPONSIVENESS

CLASS - 1

What is responsiveness?

A design of webpage with which it looks good on all devices.
laptop, phone, ipad, tablet etc.
display:grid;

Grid area:

the numbers written in front of grid=column-start and such properties are the number of lines.
the gaps are called lines

now rather than using different commands for row and col start and end we csn also use grid-area



grid-area:grid-row-start/grid-column-start/grid-row-end/grid-column-end

grid-template-area: in this we name rows and colums and then create our layoutdoub

doubt on grid template
