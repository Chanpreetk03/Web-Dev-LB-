What is Javascript?
its a light weight programming language 
it can also be called scripting language

client side scripting language.
to run js we need js engine(an enviornmen t with which we use to run js)

then it was added in c++ programme called node and hence it can also be used server side.
the the computer which sends you data is server.
the print statement is consol.log("")

console is a tool in web to log and print info

script can be added in head tag too
but the best practice is for script tag to added at the end of body
so user experience ko achha karne ke liye we put it at end.

everything in '' is called string.
collection of characters
semi colon is used to end the line
comment is a line which is not executed

best practice we make a different file for js stuff
