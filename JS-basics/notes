JS BASICS 



CLASS 1
html is used to make skeleton(what?)
css is used for style(appearance)
JS is used for behaviour and functionality

take your hand for example: the bones is html the skin is css and moving your hand is js

What is Javascript?
its a light weight programming language 
it can also be called scripting language

client side scripting language.
to run js we need js engine(an enviornmen t with which we use to run js)

then it was added in c++ programme called node and hence it can also be used server side.
the the computer which sends you data is server.
the print statement is consol.log("")

console is a tool in web to log and print info

script can be added in head tag too
but the best practice is for script tag to added at the end of body
so user experience ko achha karne ke liye we put it at end.

everything in '' is called string.
collection of characters
semi colon is used to end the line
comment is a line which is not executed

best practice we make a different file for js stuff
and link html and js

Do we need active internet connection to use console in web browser
JAVA V/S JAVASCRIPT

Variable:
named memory location is called variable

we can use let and var to create var in js
JS is dynamically typed language and hence we dont we need to tell it the type of datatype

variable name : var a=10
a is the variable name

the difference between var and let is the scope of variables.
the scope of variable made using let is in the code block it was made in.
we can not redeclare the let variables.
the variable made using var is global

const a=5
fixed value
this one also jst works in its own scope

the rules of variable naming:
-not a reserved keyword
-they should be meaningful
-can not contain " " or hyphen"-"
-cant start with numbers
-use camelCasing

PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES:
-string (sequence of characters "lojkl")
-number(1,2,3 all types int float etc)
-bool(true or false)
-null(empty )
-undefined(something which has not been defined let a; clg(a); in c++ this gives garbage value in js it gives undefined)

DYNAMIC TYPING

in c++ you cant 
int a=5 
a="babbar"


in js you can
let a=5
a=babbar

REFERENCE TYPE DATA TYPES

OBJECTS(multiple variables linked in ways we can make them objects using a class)
ARRAYS(list of (similar kind of )items data-structures in js there can be different types of items)
FUNCTION

How to make objects:
let person{
    firstname:"chan",
    lastName:"kaur",
    age:20
};

the person is the name of object
ways to access the values in them.
person.age()
person['age']  why??

How to make arrays:
let names=['love' , 'af' ,'husk']

to access the values of array we use index
names[0]

names[3]="rahul"
to add
names[1]=1 will over-ride
