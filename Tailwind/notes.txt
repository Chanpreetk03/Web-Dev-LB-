TAILWIND CSS





Pre defined class.  and made components. not external css sheet required.
with media queries and 
speed of code is also fast.

framework is a tool which makes our work easier.
to convert a simple nav bar to flex in plain css we have to first create a class then in the style tag or in the external css sheet we have to declare the tag and say display:flex
in tailwind you simply say that the class is flex class="flex"

if we use cdn we dont get suggestions

another way to use tailwind is called post css here we also get suggestions

you can also go to github thepranaygupta/html*tailwind-css-starter-pack 

we use the group property when the child depends on the parent element

Something to notice :
when we work on the top level div(the div which has all the content in it) we work on its dimension properties like margin padding width height etc
we set the dimensions first.

the difference between border ans stroke is:
when we apply border the dimensions of the content is lessened and in the case of stroke the outer area is used for border.
