TAILWIND CSS





Pre defined class.  and made components. not external css sheet required.
with media queries and 
speed of code is also fast.

framework is a tool which makes our work easier.
to convert a simple nav bar to flex in plain css we have to first create a class then in the style tag or in the external css sheet we have to declare the tag and say display:flex
in tailwind you simply say that the class is flex class="flex"

if we use cdn we dont get suggestions

another way to use tailwind is called post css here we also get suggestions
