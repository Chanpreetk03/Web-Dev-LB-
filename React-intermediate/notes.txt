How to make forms in React
in react we use hook to accumulate the data we just have to send the data to api.

Controlled components:
whole data is being tracked in form data




REACT ROUTER
what is react router?
jab aap navigation karna chahte ho without reload
as react is spa we change the same page dynamically.
we have single html file. usi mein dynamically changes

so to navigate between different pages we use react router.

same page pe different component  
so for this we install react router dom


browser router tag: it links the routes to all the pages
route:(path) 
routing means to tell the path to reach a page
navlink is better than link as it adds a class active whenever its clicked 

here home is /
about is /about
support /support
labs /labs

now we can say that home is parent route and so we can also do nested routing
if you just cut the / and put rout at end
home element wont let other be rendered
this can changed by outlet in home.js

but even then the print would be
this is support
this is home

the 2nd line is not needed

one way is to fix this is to remove the stuff from home.js
the better way is to create a new component called main header.js

and create a default rout (it wont have a path in the component)

useNavigate hook
