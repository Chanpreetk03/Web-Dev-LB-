redux and state manegment

need for redux?
consider you have an hirearchy of components
so to communicate we did prop drilling and state lifting so we used useContext and context api which created a centralised store and all the layers can communicate easily.

We have another way called redux its a library used for state manegment
Here also you will have a global state for interation but this also has the concept of slices
We can create slices which stores info 

global store has all data
this store is made by combination of portions of data(a portion of data:slices) 

we use redux toolkit
