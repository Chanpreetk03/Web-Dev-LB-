CSS BASICS



CSS BASICS - 1
html is skeleton/backbone (answers what? about a website(gives a meaning))
css is looks(answers how?(how will the content look))
colors,width,size, font-family,etc

CSS - cascading style sheets
properties of the website

to style a website and format it and make it more beautiful.

What are selectors in CSS?

A way in which we select an element/elements. 
in <style>
    table{
        color: aliceblue;
    }
</style>

table is selector, color is property and aliceblueis valur what we want.

SIMPLE SELECTOR 

1) element selector: type/tag selectors
<p>this is my para</p>
so in style when we use p as the selector we are using a tag to change the value.
All the para will for example have the same color as value given

2) class selector:
we dont want all the p to be of same color obviously same with pictures, tables.
lets say we have 3 paragraphs and you want to color on two paras and not on the middle one.
we open it using .classname{
    properties:values
}
many elements can have the same class

3)id selector:
id is unique. no 2 students can have same ids(example)
no two tags can have two same ids.
to change about a specific tag
we use it by:
#idName{
    properties:values
}


Psuedo-class selector:
A keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of selected elements 
:hover (change when hover)
many pseusdo classes(goooglee)


Multiple selector:grouping selector
table,tr,td{

}
this is a multiple selector

Universal selector

nested selectors

attribute selectors

How to add stylying to html?
inline(style tag in opening bracket)(not that good practice)
internal(style tag in head tag)
external(link a sheet)(majority)(whatever was written in style tag)  


Specifity:
which property would be picked?
element/ id/class
!important is bad practice

least specifity: tag
then: class
after class: id;
after id : inline
wherever you write !important that one is picked regardless


BOX model in css:
every element on pages is a rectangular box and have these properties:
width,height, margin,border, padding

margin is outermost and iteracts with diff divs

space between a b and c 
border is what we gave 1px solid black outerline

then the space between border and content is padding

then the width and height are of content.

inspect mein dabba

the automatic margin is 8 px

Colors in css:

Hexadecimal(#fff)
all values go from 00 to ff
1st one is r 
2nd is green
3rd is blue
(#rrggbb)

RGB colors:
rgb(__ , __ , __)
every one values goes from 0 to 255
4th value is opacity (called alpha value)
140 color are pre defined

Font:
Font family:
font-height:
font style:
emphasis and importance:
how to add ext fonts

box sizing.

if your width and height are strict what will happen if content increases.


Units in CSS
What is px?
pixel we discuss is css px other is hardware open

we discuss = 1/ 96 inch
1)Absolute units:
mm, cm, in ,px(here its fixed)
high resolution divce means more hardware pixels(more hardware pixels in an area.)

Percentage unit:
div(width 10%)
jo bhi parent hoga the width would apply wrt that

Relative units:
viewport
vw:1/100*width of viewport
vh:1/100*heigth of viewport

relative unit to font size
em: 1 em = 1* parent font size
rem: relative to root(relative to html)
