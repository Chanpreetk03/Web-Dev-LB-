CSS BASICS



CSS BASICS - 1
html is skeleton/backbone (answers what? about a website(gives a meaning))
css is looks(answers how?(how will the content look))
colors,width,size, font-family,etc

CSS - cascading style sheets
properties of the website

to style a website and format it and make it more beautiful.

What are selectors in CSS?

A way in which we select an element/elements. 
in <style>
    table{
        color: aliceblue;
    }
</style>

table is selector, color is property and aliceblueis valur what we want.

SIMPLE SELECTOR 

1) element selector: type/tag selectors
<p>this is my para</p>
so in style when we use p as the selector we are using a tag to change the value.
All the para will for example have the same color as value given

2) class selector:
we dont want all the p to be of same color obviously same with pictures, tables.
lets say we have 3 paragraphs and you want to color on two paras and not on the middle one.
we open it using .classname{
    properties:values
}
many elements can have the same class

3)id selector:
id is unique. no 2 students can have same ids(example)
no two tags can have two same ids.
to change about a specific tag
we use it by:
#idName{
    properties:values
}


Psuedo-class selector:
A keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of selected elements 
:hover (change when hover)
many pseusdo classes(goooglee)


Multiple selector:grouping selector
table,tr,td{

}
this is a multiple selector

Universal selector

nested selectors

attribute selectors

How to add stylying to html?
inline(style tag in opening bracket)(not that good practice)
internal(style tag in head tag)
external(link a sheet)(majority)(whatever was written in style tag)  


Specifity:
which property would be picked?
element/ id/class
!important is bad practice

least specifity: tag
then: class
after class: id;
after id : inline
wherever you write !important that one is picked regardless


BOX model in css:
every element on pages is a rectangular box and have these properties:
width,height, margin,border, padding

margin is outermost and iteracts with diff divs

space between a b and c 
border is what we gave 1px solid black outerline

then the space between border and content is padding

then the width and height are of content.

inspect mein dabba

the automatic margin is 8 px

Colors in css:

Hexadecimal(#fff)
all values go from 00 to ff
1st one is r 
2nd is green
3rd is blue
(#rrggbb)

RGB colors:
rgb(__ , __ , __)
every one values goes from 0 to 255
4th value is opacity (called alpha value)
140 color are pre defined

Font:
Font family:
font-height:
font style:
emphasis and importance:
how to add ext fonts

box sizing.

if your width and height are strict what will happen if content increases.


Units in CSS
What is px?
pixel we discuss is css px other is hardware open

we discuss = 1/ 96 inch
1)Absolute units:
mm, cm, in ,px(here its fixed)
high resolution divce means more hardware pixels(more hardware pixels in an area.)

Percentage unit:
div(width 10%)
jo bhi parent hoga the width would apply wrt that

Relative units:
viewport
vw:1/100*width of viewport
vh:1/100*heigth of viewport

relative unit to font size
em: 1 em = 1* parent font size
rem: relative to root(relative to html)

CSS basics - 3



Gradients: we shift from one color to another.(smooth transition)
linear( goes up, down left-right, diagnally)
, radial(elliptical or circular form)
, conic()

default top to bottom
last statement gets picked and rest are over ridden.

Shadow effit:
Text , box

text will atleast have 2 values horizontal, vertical
1st is horizontal value next vertical the next blur 
we can apply multiple shadows too.
in box in default condition color of text is the color of shadow.
spread attribute.

DIMENSION properties:
width , height , min/max

max height and max width define the height and width after which if the content is added it will overflow(scroll , hidden , auto, visible)

if the height and width is less than min one's then the box will be of min one's size otherwise it'll increase


CSS position property

static: things are positioned as they are entered(default)

relative:(to its relative position) setting top, right, left , bottom

fixed

absolute

sticky

CSS BASICS  - 3

Flexbox
1d lay out model used for space distribution and use its alignment capabilities too.

all elements in the main body are called child or flex items 
horizontal is main axis and cross is vertical axis 
most famous

Flex container properties:

flex direction
flex wrap
flex flow
justify content
align items
align content

Consider you have a box and it has A written in it.
Move the A to top-left corner top-right corner, bottm-left corner,bottom-right corner , center 
justify content center and align content center

<!-- Flex item properties:
order
flex-grow
flex shrink
flex basis
flex
align self -->
doubts!!!!


paralax effect: when in same frame one thing moves faster than the others. one image is far away from one another.

grid
flexbox is related to content 1d
grid is to layout 2d

grid is a 2d layout 
space between rows is called row gap and between two cols is col gap.
gaps are also called gutters
flexbox is how content flows and grid is layout

IMAGE GALLERY PROJECT

Heading with h1/h2 and use text align property to make it center
Now images:
all have different dimensions but have same size on page
on hover they become colored and also has shadow and we use figure tag as we also have to add caption. without hover it is black and white without shadow.
this page is also responsive.
the space between images is also equal(gap,space between,etc)
on hover we also have gradients from bottom of black color.
the caption is also visible only on hover. the images are centered.
three images in one line
images also have rounded corners. and there is a transition when the image changes from black and white to colored.
when we hover the size of image also increases same with txt.

the background color is also set.
there is a favicon also.
the title is my gallery.
overflow on x is hidden (not scroll in right)
the size of container is also set
font family
